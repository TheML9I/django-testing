# django-testing
The Cook Book how to make Django (and not only) tests.

Practice, practice and again....

Some information about Django testing form my (maybe and your) working days.

Too many information about how to test one plus one or checking 'Hello world' message out and not enaugh about how to make Django tests right.
Right?! Really?! I think that's right!

It doesn't about Client use. It's about tests...

You're welcome!
